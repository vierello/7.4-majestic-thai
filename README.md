# Majestic Thai

###This application is a menu for a restaurant named Majestic Thai.

###This project was built in week 7 using backbone and react.

For this project I was given very broad, open instructions about what the client wanted and used those instructions to create wire frames to layout an idea for the restaurant's menu. After creating the wire frames I used backbone and react to create a dynamic menu that updates a cart when you click on a menu item to order it.
